**`Abstract:`**

Large macromolecules, or proteins, play vital roles in biological functions such as catalyzing metabolic events, structural support, and cell-to-cell communication. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between these molecules are crucial for various biological processes, including signal transduction, gene expression, and cell cycle regulation. Understanding PPIs is essential for drug development, particularly in addressing diseases like cancer.

This study utilizes computational models, including `Graph Convolution Network (GCN)`, `Graph Attention Network (GAT)`, and `a hybrid GCN+RNN`, to predict PPIs. Leveraging a dataset with protein edges (graph) and Gene Ontology annotations, we aim to automate and enhance PPI prediction. This approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient method in drug discovery and therapeutic development.
